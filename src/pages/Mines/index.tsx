            Client Seed: This is a random hexadecimal string generated by your
            computer. The server does know about this client seed prior to the
            bet execution. Ideally, it should be freshly generated for each bet.
            However, some players have their "lucky" client seed which they
            prefer to keep.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server Seed: This is a random hexadecimal string generated by the
            server. It is not shared with the player (until they rotate the
            seed).
          </li>
          <li>
            Server Seed Hash: Since the server seed is not shared with the user,
            the server provides you with a hash of the server seed. This means
            that you can check (after the seed is rotated) whether the server
            was using the correct, shown server seed or not. The server seed
            hash is always unique and corresponds to a server seed being used to
            play games previously.
